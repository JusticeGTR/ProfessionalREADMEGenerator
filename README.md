## Installation
You'll need vsCode or something similar, and will need to install inquirer from the npm database. Once you create your .gitignore, use npm init -y in an integrated terminal. Next, input npm install inquirer.
## Usage
Once everything is installed, input node index.js to initiate the app and follow the promps! At the end, you'll have your brand new README!
